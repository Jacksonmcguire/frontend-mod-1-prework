## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The superlearner article was eye opening to me in how much it touched on reading, I read probably 1 book every month or two, but I am going to try my best to up that to at least 1 a month or hopefully 1 every two weeks. I also was intrigued by the quote in the article, "The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to transfer it to another" I had known that sharing and teaching is a great way to learn but not to the extent that I realize now. Im going to take advantage of that and share new knowledge with friends and family and peers because it benefits everyone around but most of all helps to ingrain that information in your head to make sure that it doesn't slip away when you haven't practiced for a couple weeks.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
The data types I learned about in section 1 are, numbers, strings, and booleans. Numbers are numerical values, with or without decimals and containing all negative and positive integers. Strings are words, phrases, or anything in quotes. Booleans are represented by either true or false.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log('Hello World');
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
With comments in JS you would use // for a comment, however if you wanted to create a multi line comment you would have to use /*. Comments are used to either stop a line of code from being used or to write in non compputer friendly terms in order to define what is going on there or comment about anything in the file.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
I would explain variables to a 5 year old as the way that computers are able to remember things and holds them for later, similar to if you had birthday party to go to on saturday, you might not remember that on your own and maybe would put it on the calendar where it has the date and address and relevant details(the values).
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I frequently find myself on youtube and when watching any given video some variables may be the title of the video, the date provided, and the color of the text that you see on the screen. The title is a string, date, number, and color of text probably a string as well.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is a method the computer uses to combine strings with other strings or other data types.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
On youtube, the variable that shows the date will not just be a single integer or date like 12 it will be combined with a string or multiple to display Oct 12th 2020 for example.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I have two questions, wondering what the difference between concatenation and type_coercion and also a little confused about how to identify variables in websites, have no problem with declaring them in JS or anything on the my technical side, moreso confused about how you know where the variables are on youtube to refer to my example in the previous question.
