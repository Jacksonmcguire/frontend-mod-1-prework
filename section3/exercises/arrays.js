//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length)

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = 'Gorilla';
console.log(animals[2]);
// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push('Rhino');
console.log(animals.indexOf('Rhino'));

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);//Not sure where I went wrong because I thought we were deleting ELephant and reassigning it to gorilla.

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var groceryList = ['Tomatoes', 'Cucumbers', 'Carrots', 'Celery'];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(groceryList.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
groceryList.unshift('broccoli');
console.log(groceryList);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
groceryList.pop();
console.log(groceryList);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
groceryList.push('Milk', 'Eggs', 'Bread');
console.log(groceryList);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
groceryList.shift();
console.log(groceryList);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: I see lists storing data utilized in youtube a lot, The subscribtions page on youtube might have an array such as ['Tiny house video', 'dog video', 'JS tutorial']
// that hold each of those respecitve videos data in that array.
// 2: Also in youtube the recommended page probably uses a list, This list would probably be something quite similar to my last example, but instead of
// pulling data from your subscribed pages, it pulls data that has been formed to be similar to what you like.
// 3: Lastly in youtube you might see the settings page having a list or array of options on the sidebar, ['Account', 'Notifications', 'Playback and Performance' etc]
// this array allows you to visit a unique page with each option of the list, having to store all of these values in individual strings would get tedious.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
//This if else statement will determine if the user has 15% of battery left and ignore the other variables because
//they are not relavant. If the user has 15% of battery or more they will receive a message telling them that they can call an uber and if not, vise versa.
if(percentBatteryLeft >= 15){
  console.log('You can call an Uber');
} else {
  console.log('Sorry, you cannot call an Uber');
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
