## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
In the Growth Mindset video my biggest takeaways were that thinking you aren't cut out for something or don't have the ability to do or learn something is completely normal, but the way you look at those struggles is what differentiates still and growth mindsets. When you are faced with a struggle and you look at that as an opportunity to learn or rather figure a way to get around that struggle you are implementing a growth mindset and understand that you can learn anything with practice and time. If you are faced with struggles and simply resort to "im not cut out for this" or anything else that leads you to quit, you are showing a still or stagnant mindset with no real desire to grow and learn. These aren't mutally exclusive however, there is a spectrum of sorts you may have times where you are in a growth mindset or some fields where you are, and some material and times where you are convinced you can't do it. Not to say that all of this was completely new to me but having laid out clearly was pretty interesting especially with the fact that you can program your brain to change your mindset and figure out tricks or routines to help yourself do that.
The biggest thing I took away from the 2-part article about Growth mindset was not to compare yourself to others, just keep track of your progress. It doesn't matter if someone is seemingly learning faster than you or able to pick up material easier, as long as you are learning you are moving forward and it's better to do that at your own pace than rush yourself and put uncomfortable pressure on yourself to succeed when you are already succeeding.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I like to think that for the most part I demonstrate a growth mindset, I am a firm believer in practice/grinding it out to get better, I generally won't say that I have a knowledge of something unless I have put in plenty of hours of practice and research and for lack of a better term have mastered the subject. Whenever I get into something, I go super deep. With that being said, I have a lot to improve on and that is part of the reason I have started reading Mindset by Carol Dweck, it is fairly hard to get myself interested and committed enough to ideas that aren't number 1 on my list of priorities and sometimes need external motivation. I would like to be able to delve into topics that are not necessarily interests of my own better/be able to fully commit myself for interests of others, or big picture interests of myself.
3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
A web application that I am on pretty frequently is youtube, I would venture to guess that a lot of what you see on a given youtube website is thanks to arrays. When you are looking at your subscription box you are seeing a list of videos from people that you subscribe to, the data for all of these values(the videos/titles you are seeing) would likely be in an array both to keep in chronological order and mostly to avoid having to create different variables to store all of the data that is in your subscription page.
4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is pretty much a method built into JS that allows you to change the contents of an array, whether thats to push, add an element to the end of an array, pop, remove the last item from an array, or one of many other methods that allow you to modify the contents of any given array after it is been declared and assigned.
5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to write the code you want to run for any number of values or variables once, and have it run as many times as you wants which saves you from having to individually write a ton of unnecessary code. You would use a loop in conjunction with an array when you have an array assigned to a variable and are looking to apply something to more than one of the items in that array, to save time and sanity. In general it makes a lot of sense to use loops with arrays because you might want to perform an action on multiple items in an array, you can also use loops with strings, integers, and other data types that you are looking to have a function be performed a certain number of times, but with arrays list format they go hand in hand with loops.
6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
If you wanted to watch your favorite shows on netflix, you wouldn't want to be sent to the home screen after each episode and have to find your way all the way back and find the episode you want to watch. You would want the episodes to keep playing one after another in the correct order, this is one way loops work in coding with computers. You are able to watch a whole season(array) without having the computer turn off netflix, thankfully netflix has made plenty of loops and once you finish your episode the computer won't have to figure out what to do, it will know to go to the next episode until there are none left.
7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Confused about the difference between elements and items in an array. Also had some trouble with infinite loops when checking results with node in the terminal for the exercises, I fixed all of the infinite loops, but wondering if there is a way to check whether or not a loop will be infinite before logging to console and having to forcequit out and restart.
