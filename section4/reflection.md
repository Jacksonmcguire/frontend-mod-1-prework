## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
My workflow felt pretty good, found myself taking more frequent but shorter breaks and being able to dive right back into the work upon returning to my desk which sort of surprised me.
2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I found that it was about the same when it came to estimating my time but in my Pomodoro experience I noticed that I was working harder in those 30 minutes because it was such a short chunk of time and I wanted to get as much done as I could. Im not sure how often I will remember to set timers for work chunks and break chunks, but I definitely think the idea will stick and I will continue to work with my own internal version of the pomodoro technique.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An Object is a data type that allows you to store a more complex and larger amount of data similar to an array. That being said an array stores an ordered list and each item in that list can only be accessed by index(numerical order of string or data in the list), whereas an object can access internal data and values with both index and strings.
4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  An array would be better to store it, because all of the data types will be strings and having them be only accessible through an ordered list would be fine.
  * List of states and their capitals
  Again, an array would do the trick as the value of states and their capitals could be held in one single string in an array and it would be easier to keep track of them through their alphabetical rankings in an ordered list.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Once again, an array would work because you don't really need to specify anything more than the items themselves which creating an object to do the same would be unnecessary.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Also would say an array, if more data was trying to be presented I would say object but with only the names of the followed accounts, there is not really anymore data than the strings of the names listed.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  For this I would use an object because you need to have dynamic data for the students cohort if they get moved up on the waitlist and start at an earlier cohort for example. You would be able to have multiple properties such as their names and cohort that you can feed new values in for as needed.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  I would use an Object for this as well because you do not only need the ingredient list but how much of each ingredient which can change depending on the baker whether they want a smaller cake than the recipe calls for or larger or whatever it may be, but it would make sense to have an Object declared for this.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  I would use an array because it would be pretty simple strings and if I found a new favorite restaurant to add to the list I could always .push or any other method to add or remove elements to my array.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I would gather that doordash uses object data, if you were say ordering a burrito, you can add toppings, remove toppings etc, some of the keys might be your address, name, payment info, time of order, estimated time of arrival. An example might be if you had setup your address previously to the address you were living at in the past and when you move you go to order and almost order it to your old house, you would have to update the values of those address keys to be that of your new location.
6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Wondering how to make subclasses, ex Dog class, lab subclass with unique properties that aren't necessarily true to the bigger Dog class but is there a way to pretty much create instances of instances not by using methods learned in this section.
